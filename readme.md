## 🔍 Available Writeups

### TryHackMe

#### [JVM Reverse Engineering Room](./tryhackme/jvmreverseengineering/)
- [Task 7: Extreme Obfuscation](./tryhackme/jvmreverseengineering/task7/) - Solving a heavily obfuscated Java challenge using reflection and dynamic analysis

## 🛠️ Custom Tools

Many writeups include custom tools I've developed to solve specific challenges:

- **Java Reflection Tools**: For analyzing obfuscated Java bytecode
- **Dynamic Analysis Scripts**: For understanding program behavior at runtime
- **Deobfuscation Utilities**: For simplifying complex, intentionally obscured code

## 💡 Methodology

My approach to solving CTF challenges typically follows these steps:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Understanding the challenge scope and requirements
2. **Analysis**: Identifying key components and potential attack vectors
3. **Tool Development**: Creating custom tools when standard approaches fail
4. **Exploitation**: Applying the right techniques to solve the challenge
5. **Documentation**: Thorough writeups explaining the process and lessons learned

## 🔗 Featured Challenges

- [JVM Reverse Engineering - Task 7](./tryhackme/jvmreverseengineering/task7/) - A complex Java reverse engineering challenge requiring custom reflection-based tools to extract a password from heavily obfuscated code.
